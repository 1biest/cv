As part of the Cosmos ecosystem, we were able to leverage open-source software deployed on other platforms.

      "content2": "The most significant challenge in porting this Cosmos repository was adapting it to the EVM-compatible architecture of Injective.

Additionally, several quality enhancements were implemented, such as decoding messages from Base64 and enabling formatted output for improved debugging and error detection.
