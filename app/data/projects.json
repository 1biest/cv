My responsibilities have spanned across frontend engineering, UI/UX design, branding, deployments, and overall user experience strategy. I also led the development of the <a href=\"https://nept.finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Neptune Landing</strong></a> site.

As part of the Cosmos ecosystem, we were able to leverage open-source software deployed on other platforms.
